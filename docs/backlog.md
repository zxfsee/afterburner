# Backlog

Parked items live here until promoted into the active TODO queue.

## Direction

- Target system shape is a contract-first end-to-end MLOps pipeline: `data -> train -> eval -> promote -> deploy -> observe -> rollback`.
- This is a narrative model, not a priority rule. Active work is still driven by the runnable TODO queue and dependency unlocks.
- Promotion rule (default): promote the highest-priority runnable backlog item into the active TODO horizon.

Rules:
- Keep this list priority-ranked within backlog.
- Every item must declare metadata: `Goal`, `Scope`, `Contracts`, `Boundary`, `Kind`, and `Blocked-by` when applicable.
- `Blocked-by` should reference exact active TODO/backlog item titles (or stable IDs/pointers if available); include short inline context only when needed.
- Items must exist in exactly one place: active TODO queue or backlog (not both).
- Promotion into active TODO queue must preserve priority order and dependency constraints.

## Items

- Burn dependency refresh gate [Frameworks, Runtime Infra]
  - Goal: Keep the pinned Burn stack reasonably current and record any recorder/storage contract drift before it leaks into Afterburner artifact decisions by surprise.
  - Kind: `gate`
  - Boundary: `core-contract`
  - Contracts: `none`
  - Scope: `Cargo.toml`, `Cargo.lock`, `tests/`, `README.md`, `docs/adr/`

- Burn `.bpk` artifact migration contract [Frameworks, Runtime Infra]
  - Goal: Migrate the repo's inference artifact contract from `.mpk` to `.bpk` only after a pinned Burn refresh confirms the target APIs and the repo is ready to cut over docs, fixtures, CLI paths, and event payloads together.
  - Kind: `mixed`
  - Boundary: `core-contract`
  - Contracts: `artifact`, `cli`, `event`
  - Scope: `Cargo.toml`, `src/`, `fixtures/`, `tests/`, `README.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/adr/`
  - Blocked-by: Burn dependency refresh gate.

- JSON to RON format fit investigation gate [Data Infra, Runtime Infra]
  - Goal: Evaluate whether any current JSON-based artifact or event surfaces should migrate to RON, and whether the readability or ergonomics gains would justify the contract churn and tooling impact.
  - Kind: `gate`
  - Boundary: `core-contract`
  - Contracts: `artifact`, `event`
  - Scope: `docs/adr/`, `README.md`, `tests/`
